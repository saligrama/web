# Aditya Saligrama

I'm a Stanford undergraduate and graduate student with extensive industry, research, teaching, and competition experience in computer systems and cybersecurity. 

Currently, I'm a software engineering intern at [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com) working on zero-trust networking. I'm also a security researcher with [Stanford ESRG](https://esrg.stanford.edu), the president of [Stanford Applied Cyber](https://applied-cyber.stanford.edu), and a co-director of the [Stanford Security Clinic](https://securityclinic.org). I recently taught Stanford's [CS 40](https://infracourse.cloud) *Cloud Infrastructure and Scalable Application Deployment*.
